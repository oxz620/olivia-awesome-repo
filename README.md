The code in this repository develops the "Find New Friends" page for the "Me N U" social connection platform. On this page, there is a navigation bar at the bottom, as well as a logout button in the header. Three profiles will appear at once, with avatars and a larger image, as well as text beneath them serving as a bio. There is a search bar at the top of the page and checkboxes to filter with on the right to provide search criteria.
